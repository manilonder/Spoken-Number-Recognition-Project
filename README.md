# Spoken-Number-Recognition-Project

The goal of the project is to create a system that can detect and display numbers from 0 to 9 when they are spoken to it via sound signals by a human (analog signals). The system must be created utilizing an FPGA board (Basys-3) and the Hardware Description Language (HDL) (VHDL). The project's goal is to achieve maximum accuracy in identifying and presenting numbers based on the information provided to the system.
